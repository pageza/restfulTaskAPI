# Restful Tasks API

Create an application with endpoints (routing rules) which offer CRUD operations for 'tasks'. We should be able to use this API for the following commands:

- [x] GET: Retrieve all Tasks
- [x] GET: Retrieve a Task by ID
- [x] POST: Create a Task
- [x] PUT: Update a Task by ID
- [x] DELETE: Delete a Task by ID

The tasks should be returned in a JSON format. Consider the tasks as objects with the following properties:

- [x] _id: (string) (default id generated by mongoDB)
- [x] title: (string)
- [x] description: (string, default to empty string)
- [x] completed: (boolean, default to: false)
- [x] created_at: (date, default to current date)
- [x] updated_at: (date, default to current date)

Once your API is complete and your routing rules are in place, and follow the 'restful routing' standards, use the 'postman' browser extension to test your routing rules. 'Postman' is a simple (and quite popular) browser extension that allows you to prepare your own HTTP requests, serving as an ideal tool for testing your server's API.
